
Exception is a condition if it not be execute then other
- codes are not be face any problem to execute
When we run a program in case of runtime if any error will occur then other lines of code not be executed in that we handle this error
Exceptions can be handled using Exception handling 

Exception are two types-:
1.Built in Exception
2.User Define Exception-In this case we write 
    Syntax-raise keyword Exception name("Exception message)


Python give 4 blocks to handle Exception
1-try block ->it is necessary block which execute always
     if occur any error then except block will execute otherwise else block will execute
2-except block ->In this block we handle error which will come
3-else block ->In this block execute directly  
4-finally block ->It is a special block it is execute always whether error occurs or not
    It is use most in file handling.

Note. We also handle multiple error in that case we will write again except 
block and type error otherwise we type as

        except (ZeroDivisionError ,otherName of error)or Exception as obj
            print(obj)
