NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists,
 so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

NumPy arrray is faster than list because it store data at continuous location in RAM
 List store data in continuous location but in Ram list data are stored in different-different address.

In NumPy library data are inserted through list/tuple
    But if you want to insert data from set than it show like set data

NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.

type(): This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object passed to it.
 Like in above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.

We also create n-dimensional array pass multiple list/tuple in [list1,list2.....] (tuple1.tuple2....)

To Know of array which dimensional use arrayName.ndim

The main difference between a copy and a view of an array is that the copy is a new array, 
and the view is just a view of the original array.

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
x = arr.copy() in this case x array is create copy of arr 
arr[0] = 42

print(arr)
print(x)


import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
x = arr.view() in this case x array is view like original arr
arr[0] = 42

print(arr)
print(x)
